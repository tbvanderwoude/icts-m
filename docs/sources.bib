	abstract = {Pathfinding in uniform-cost grid environments is a problem commonly found in application areas such as robotics and video games. The state-of-the-art is dominated by hierarchical pathfinding algorithms which are fast and have small memory overheads but usually return suboptimal paths. In this paper we present a novel search strategy, specific to grids, which is fast, optimal and requires no memory overhead. Our algorithm can be described as a macro operator which identifies and selectively expands only certain nodes in a grid map which we call jump points. Intermediate nodes on a path connecting two jump points are never expanded. We prove that this approach always computes optimal solutions and then undertake a thorough empirical analysis, comparing our method with related works from the literature. We find that searching with jump points can speed up A* by an order of magnitude and more and report significant improvement over the current state of the art.},

	abstract = {In the multi-agent pathfinding problem (MAPF) we are given a set of agents each with respective start and goal positions. The task is to find paths for all agents while avoiding collisions. Most previous work on solving this problem optimally has treated the individual agents as a single ‘joint agent’ and then applied single-agent search variants of the A* algorithm. In this paper we present the Conflict Based Search (CBS) a new optimal multi-agent pathfinding algorithm. CBS is a two-level algorithm that does not convert the problem into the single ‘joint agent’ model. At the high level, a search is performed on a Conflict Tree (CT) which is a tree based on conflicts between individual agents. Each node in the CT represents a set of constraints on the motion of the agents. At the low level, fast single-agent searches are performed to satisfy the constraints imposed by the high level CT node. In many cases this two-level formulation enables CBS to examine fewer states than A* while still maintaining optimality. We analyze CBS and show its benefits and drawbacks. Additionally we present the Meta-Agent CBS (MA-CBS) algorithm. MA-CBS is a generalization of CBS. Unlike basic CBS, MA-CBS is not restricted to single-agent searches at the low level. Instead, MA-CBS allows agents to be merged into small groups of joint agents. This mitigates some of the drawbacks of basic CBS and further improves performance. In fact, MA-CBS is a framework that can be built on top of any optimal and complete MAPF solver in order to enhance its performance. Experimental results on various problems show a speedup of up to an order of magnitude over previous approaches.}

	abstract = {Cooperative Pathfinding is a multi-agent path planning problem where agents must find non-colliding routes to separate destinations, given full information about the routes of other agents. This paper presents three new algorithms for efficiently solving this problem, suitable for use in Real-Time Strategy games and other real-time environments. The algorithms are decoupled approaches that break down the problem into a series of single-agent searches. Cooperative A* (CA*) searches space-time for a non-colliding route. Hierarchical Cooperative A* (HCA*) uses an abstract heuristic to boost performance. Finally, Windowed Hierarchical Cooperative A* (WHCA*) limits the space-time search depth to a dynamic window, spreading computation over the duration of the route. The algorithms are applied to a series of challenging, maze-like environments, and compared to A* with Local Repair (the current video-games industry standard). The results show that the new algorithms, especially WHCA*, are robust and efficient solutions to the Cooperative Pathfinding problem, finding more successful routes and following better paths than Local Repair A*.},

The contest has appeared on a regular basis since 1999 and always concerns an applied optimization problem proposed by an industrial partner. The 2014 edition of the ROADEF/EURO challenge was led by the Innovation {\&} Research department of SNCF, a global leader in passenger and freight transport services, and infrastructure manager of the French railway network. The objective of the challenge was to find the best way to store and move trains on large railway sites, between their arrivals and departures. Since trains never vanish and traffic continues to increase, in recent years some stations have been having real congestion issues. Train management in large railway sites is of high interest for SNCF, which is why it was submitted to the operations research community as the industrial problem for the 2014 edition of the ROADEF/EURO challenge. This paper introduces the special section of the Annals of Operations Research volume devoted to the ROADEF/EURO challenge 2014, as well as the methods of the finalist teams and their results.},

Taking a further step, we study time and distance optimality of the feasible solutions, show that they have a pairwise Pareto optimal structure, and again provide efficient algorithms for optimizing two of these practical objectives.",
