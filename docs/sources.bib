@article{sturtevant2010, title={A Comparison of High-Level Approaches for Speeding Up Pathfinding}, volume={6}, abstractNote={Most games being shipped today use some form of high-level abstraction such as a navmesh or waypoint graph for path planning. These structures can generally be represented in a form which is compact enough to meet the tight memory constraints in a game. But, when such a graph grows too large, finding paths can still be a complex task. This challenge was faced in Dragon Age: Origins and solved by adding an additional level of abstraction.In the last few years a variety of novel approaches have been developed for finding optimal paths through graphs with specific design applications for road networks. Currently these techniques cannot be feasibly applied to the lowest detail of movement possible in a game map, but can be applied to the high-level abstractions which are commonly found in games.In this paper we describe the pathfinding challenge faced before shipping the title Dragon Age: Origins and perform a postmortem analysis on the extended abstraction that was used in comparison to building more advanced heuristics or the use of contraction hierarchies. We show that contraction hierarchies and abstractions have similar overhead and performance and are both useful approaches for high-level planning in games}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment}, author={Sturtevant, Nathan and Geisberger, Robert}, year={2010}, month={10}, pages={76-82}

	abstract = {In the multi-agent pathfinding problem (MAPF) we are given a set of agents each with respective start and goal positions. The task is to find paths for all agents while avoiding collisions. Most previous work on solving this problem optimally has treated the individual agents as a single ‘joint agent’ and then applied single-agent search variants of the A* algorithm. In this paper we present the Conflict Based Search (CBS) a new optimal multi-agent pathfinding algorithm. CBS is a two-level algorithm that does not convert the problem into the single ‘joint agent’ model. At the high level, a search is performed on a Conflict Tree (CT) which is a tree based on conflicts between individual agents. Each node in the CT represents a set of constraints on the motion of the agents. At the low level, fast single-agent searches are performed to satisfy the constraints imposed by the high level CT node. In many cases this two-level formulation enables CBS to examine fewer states than A* while still maintaining optimality. We analyze CBS and show its benefits and drawbacks. Additionally we present the Meta-Agent CBS (MA-CBS) algorithm. MA-CBS is a generalization of CBS. Unlike basic CBS, MA-CBS is not restricted to single-agent searches at the low level. Instead, MA-CBS allows agents to be merged into small groups of joint agents. This mitigates some of the drawbacks of basic CBS and further improves performance. In fact, MA-CBS is a framework that can be built on top of any optimal and complete MAPF solver in order to enhance its performance. Experimental results on various problems show a speedup of up to an order of magnitude over previous approaches.}

Each of the teams is given the same number of targets as there are agents in the team. Each agent has to move to exactly one target given to its team such that all targets are visited. The TAPF problem is to first assign agents to targets and then plan collision-free paths for the agents to their targets in a way such that the makespan is minimized. We present the CBM (Conflict-Based Min-Cost-Flow) algorithm, a hierarchical algorithm that solves TAPF instances optimally by combining ideas from anonymous and non-anonymous multi-agent path-finding algorithms. On the low level, CBM uses a min-cost max-flow algorithm on a time-expanded network to assign all agents in a single team to targets and plan their paths. On the high level, CBM uses conflict-based search to resolve collisions among agents in different teams. Theoretically, we prove that CBM is correct, complete and optimal. Experimentally, we show the scalability of CBM to TAPF instances with dozens of teams and hundreds of agents and adapt it to a simulated warehouse system.},

The state-of-the-art is dominated by hierarchical pathfinding algorithms which are fast and have small memory overheads but usually return suboptimal paths. In this paper we present a novel search strategy, specific to grids, which is fast, optimal and requires no memory overhead. Our algorithm can be described as a macro operator which identifies and selectively expands only certain nodes in a grid map which we call jump points. Intermediate nodes on a path connecting two jump points are never expanded. We prove that this approach always computes optimal solutions and then undertake a thorough empirical analysis, comparing our method with related works from the literature. We find that searching with jump points can speed up A* by an order of magnitude and more and report significant improvement over the current state of the art.},

Our framework is particularly well suited to generating pliable plans that adapt to continually arriving new goal locations.

Solving this capacity determination problem is very time consuming, as it requires to solve an NP-hard shunting planning problem, and furthermore, the capacity has to determined for a large number of possible scenarios at over 30 shunting yards in The Netherlands. In this paper, we propose to combine machine learning with local search in order to speed up finding shunting plans in the capacity determination problem. The local search heuristic models the activities that take place on the shunting yard as nodes in an activity graph with precedence relations. Consequently, we apply the Deep Graph Convolutional Neural Network, which is a graph classification method, to predict whether local search will find a feasible shunt plan given an initial solution. Our experimental results show our approach can significantly reduce the simulation time in determining the capacity of a given shunting yard.

This paper presents three new algorithms for efficiently solving this problem, suitable for use in Real-Time Strategy games and other real-time environments. The algorithms are decoupled approaches that break down the problem into a series of single-agent searches. Cooperative A* (CA*) searches space-time for a non-colliding route. Hierarchical Cooperative A* (HCA*) uses an abstract heuristic to boost performance. Finally, Windowed Hierarchical Cooperative A* (WHCA*) limits the space-time search depth to a dynamic window, spreading computation over the duration of the route. The algorithms are applied to a series of challenging, maze-like environments, and compared to A* with Local Repair (the current video-games industry standard). The results show that the new algorithms, especially WHCA*, are robust and efficient solutions to the Cooperative Pathfinding problem, finding more successful routes and following better paths than Local Repair A*.},

	abstract={The ROADEF/EURO challenge is a contest jointly organized by the French Operational Research and Decision Aid society (ROADEF) and the European Operational Research society (EURO). The contest has appeared on a regular basis since 1999 and always concerns an applied optimization problem proposed by an industrial partner. The 2014 edition of the ROADEF/EURO challenge was led by the Innovation {\&} Research department of SNCF, a global leader in passenger and freight transport services, and infrastructure manager of the French railway network. The objective of the challenge was to find the best way to store and move trains on large railway sites, between their arrivals and departures. Since trains never vanish and traffic continues to increase, in recent years some stations have been having real congestion issues. Train management in large railway sites is of high interest for SNCF, which is why it was submitted to the operations research community as the industrial problem for the 2014 edition of the ROADEF/EURO challenge. This paper introduces the special section of the Annals of Operations Research volume devoted to the ROADEF/EURO challenge 2014, as well as the methods of the finalist teams and their results.},
